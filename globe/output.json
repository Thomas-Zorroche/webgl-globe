A few degrees of cooling could re-create some of the glaciers (it would surely take a long time!) but because the big glaciers are pretty much gone in today's world, a few degrees of warming simply don't have any comparably spectacular effect.

In December 2006, scientists at Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico issued a report, Energy Demands on Water Resources, explaining that virtually all forms of energy production consume a lot of water. Petroleum refining, for example, consumes 1-2.5 gallons of water per gallon of refined product. Colorado scientists Kreider and Curtiss estimate that refining a gallon of corn ethanol today requires thirty-five gallons of water. But that is only the beginning. Kreider and Curtiss estimate that three times as much water is needed to grow the corn that yields a gallon of ethanol. That brings the tally to 140 gallons of water per gallon of corn ethanol produced. If their calculation is correct, the 5.4 million gallons of corn ethanol used in America in 2006 required the use of 760 million gallons of fresh water.",

The WOTUS rule is an attack on private property rights and would significantly limit land use, including energy production. More stringent ozone standards would choke off energy and economic development throughout the country and could become the most expensive regulation in history.

Apart from deaths, bushfires incinerate property, such as bridges, farm fencing, homes, and even, a few years ago, an astronomical observatory. The cost to the economy is significant. So bushfire management is, for Australians, no trivial matter. Yet, despite many enquiries since the 1930s, we still have serious bushfires, which seem to be increasing in extent and intensity.

Given that recent \"Kyoto-lite\" measures proposed in the U.S. Senatesuch as the Climate Stewardship Act sponsored by Sens. John McCain (R.-Ariz,) and Joseph Lieberman (D.-Conn.)would result in the replacement of about 78 percent of coal with high-priced fuels, it is entirely plausible that even \"baby steps\" towards climate mitigation would kill more people in the U.S. than global warming kills worldwide.

A two degree rise would see the wet tropics ecosystem start to disappear with animals needing move upslope to beat the heat. With a 3.5 degree rise 65 species unique to the area would vanish into extinction. If you live at or reach the top of the mountain there is nowhere to go. These is debate about past warm periods but these may have been wetter than today so providing some relief. Can animals genetically adapt to their new environments? Unfortunately it appears that breeding cycles are too long. Some species dont even breed every year and only have a few offspring. The other combinative effect is a change in the cloud forest with the cloud base rising each year. This may not affect water supply to the forest but also affect the water supplies in the Cairns regions.",

(It is possible that per-capita CO2 emissions were never this low even before the advent of widespread fossil fuel use, as wood burning by Americans in the nineteenth century may have produced more than 2.4 tons of CO2 per capita. Much depends on the emissions coefficient for wood burning and how, since wood is biomass rather than a fossil fuel, regrowth of forestland is credited in carbon accounting. In 1875, twice as much energy was generated from burning wood than fossil fuels.)",

Well believe it or not such may be the case, as seen for example by mountain lizards in France and butterflies in England. According to an article in World Climate Report, researchers in France discovered that, as temperatures have increased modestly in recent years, so too has the size and fertility of that nation??s mountain lizards. A similar finding regarding butterflies has also been observed, as scientists in England discovered that the richness of British butterfly species has actually increased as temperatures have warmed. Apparently some species, like some humans, like it hot.",
